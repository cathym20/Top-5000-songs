# Top 5000 Songs Dataset

This dataset contains information on the top 5000 songs based on popularity at the time the data was collected. Each row represents a single song along with basic metadata about the track and the artist. The dataset is intended for analysis and experimentation rather than as a definitive or constantly updated ranking of music.

The data includes a mix of song details and audio-related features. This covers things like the song title, artist name, album, genre where available, popularity or ranking, release year, and duration. It also includes audio features such as energy, danceability, tempo, and loudness. Some columns may contain missing values or inconsistencies, particularly for genre information.

Popularity in this dataset should be interpreted as relative rather than absolute. Rankings and scores reflect a snapshot in time and may not represent long-term success or cultural impact. Genre labels are not always precise, as many songs do not fit neatly into a single category.

The dataset has not been aggressively cleaned and reflects the kind of imperfections commonly found in real-world data. This makes it suitable for exploratory analysis, visualisation, and machine learning tasks such as clustering, prediction, or recommendation.

The data is provided in CSV format and can be loaded using standard data analysis tools such as pandas or spreadsheet software.
